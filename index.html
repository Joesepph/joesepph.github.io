                This website probably will be sitting here without any change for a <i>very</i> long time.
                Whenever it's fully finished it will be a showcase of my projects<span class="coloredPurple">/</span>skills.
                Briefly about me, I'm just a <span class="coloredBlue bold">(</span>not<span class="coloredBlue bold">)</span> regular teenager
                that is passionate about IT. I like worldbuilding and dark fantasy genre.

            <span class="sectionText">
                As mentioned above, I'm an IT enthusiast. In my free time I also enjoy
                playing video games and writing <span class="coloredBlue bold">(</span>worldbuilding and all that stuff<span class="coloredBlue bold">)</span>. I'm 19 y<span class="coloredPurple">/</span>o
                and I'm currently a High School student. In my first two years of High School I was interested in game dev
                but as time flew by it has faded away. Currently, I'm into web dev and I'm trying my best to learn
                Software Development and Cyber Security by myself <span class="coloredBlue bold">(</span>since school doesn't provide that knowledge<span class="coloredBlue bold">)</span>

                This website is still under ðŸš§<span class="coloredYellow italic">construction</span>ðŸš§. 
                I'm going to improve it and add stuff to it as my career as a developer carries on.
                Time will show how it'll go but I feel positive! I have so many ideas in my head that it's about to burst.
                But for know I gotta focus on school and studying.
